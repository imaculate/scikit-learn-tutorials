Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[25] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[21] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"[26] was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[21] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[27]
