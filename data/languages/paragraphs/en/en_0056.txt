Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[169] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[170][171] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citeable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.[172] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. "For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia", he said.[173]
