A study published by PLOS ONE in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia.[137] The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to thirty-seven percent by 2015.[138]
