Over time, the English Wikipedia and some other Wikipedias gradually have restricted modifications. For example, in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[58] On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly controversial, sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now "protected" to some degree.[59] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected, meaning that only certain editors are able to modify it.[60] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.[61]
