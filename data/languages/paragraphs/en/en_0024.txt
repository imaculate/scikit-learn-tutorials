Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[84][85] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor and is not vetted by any recognized authority.[86] Wikipedia's contributors avoid a tragedy of the commons by internalizing benefits. They do this by experiencing flow and identifying with and gaining status in the Wikipedia community.[87]
