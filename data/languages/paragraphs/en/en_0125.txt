In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,[321] and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation.[322] Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian language Wikipedia users.[323] The night of the ceremony, members of the Wikimedia Foundation held a meeting with wikipedians from all parts of Spain, including the local Asturian community.
